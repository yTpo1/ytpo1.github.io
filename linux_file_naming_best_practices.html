            for Linux file naming</h1>
            <p>Linux servers are case sensitive. Windows servers are not
            case sensitive, so if you are moving your files from a
            Windows development platform to a Linux web platform you may
            need to watch out for the following common mistakes.</p>
            <p>Mixing Upper case and lower case A common mistake is
            naming files a mixture of upper case and lower case. Like
            the following:</p>
            <p>MyFileName.html</p>
            <p>Linux reads the file name exactly the way its typed.
            So,</p>
            <p>MyFileName.html</p>
            <p>Is NOT the same as:</p>
            <p>myfilename.html</p>
            <p>Incorrect types file extension File extensions are case
            sensitive as well. Some file types have 4 letters and others
            3. See the following example:</p>
            <p>Likewise, file extensions need to be exact as well:</p>
            <p>MyFileName.HTML</p>
            <p>Is NOT the same as:</p>
            <p>myfilename.html</p>
            <p>To prevent running into problems with your file paths on
            your site, we recommend following the best practices for
            file naming. See the below:</p>
            <p>Name all your files lower case. Instead of using a space,
            use an ( _ ) or a ( â€“ )</p>
            <p>In Linux, the convention is to use lowercase for
            directory and file names. Here are some key points regarding
            this convention:</p>
            <p>Case Sensitivity: Linux is case-sensitive, meaning
            File.txt and file.txt are considered two different files.
            Using lowercase helps avoid confusion. Readability:
            Lowercase names are generally easier to read and type,
            especially in commands. Standard Practices: Many software
            projects and open-source communities adopt lowercase naming
            conventions for consistency. Underscores and Dashes: It's
            common to use underscores (_) or dashes (-) to separate
            words in file names, e.g., my_script.sh or my-script.sh.</p>
