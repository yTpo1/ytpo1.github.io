            <h1 id="message-authentication-codes-macs">Message
            authentication codes (MACs)</h1>
            <p><strong>Definition:</strong> A MAC is a short piece of
            information used to authenticate a message, providing both
            integrity and authenticity. It is generated by a
            cryptographic algorithm that takes a message and a secret
            key as inputs.</p>
            <p><strong>Purpose:</strong> MACs ensure that a message has
            not been altered in transit and that it comes from a
            legitimate source.</p>
            <h4 id="interconnections">Interconnections</h4>
            <p><strong>SHA-1 and SHA-2</strong></p>
            <ul>
            <li>SHA-1 and SHA-2: These are cryptographic hash functions.
            SHA-1 produces a 160-bit hash value, while SHA-2 includes
            various functions (like SHA-256, SHA-512) that produce hash
            values of different lengths (256 bits, 512 bits, etc.).</li>
            <li>Use in MACs: Hash functions can be used to create MACs,
            specifically in constructions like HMAC (Hash-based Message
            Authentication Code), which combines a hash function (like
            SHA-1 or SHA-2) with a secret key.</li>
            </ul>
            <p><strong>Block Ciphers and Stream Ciphers</strong></p>
            <ul>
            <li><p>Block Ciphers: These encrypt data in fixed-size
            blocks (e.g., AES). They can be used to create MACs by
            applying the cipher in a specific mode (like CMAC or
            GMAC).</p></li>
            <li><p>Stream Ciphers: These encrypt data one bit or byte at
            a time (e.g., RC4). Similar to block ciphers, stream ciphers
            can also be used to create MACs, often by processing data in
            a continuous stream.</p></li>
            <li><p><strong>MACs and Cryptographic Functions:</strong>
            Both hash functions (like SHA-1 and SHA-2) and symmetric
            encryption algorithms (block and stream ciphers) can be used
            to construct MACs. For example, HMAC uses a hash function,
            while CMAC uses a block cipher.</p></li>
            <li><p><strong>Integrity and Authenticity:</strong> While
            hash functions provide integrity checks, they do not provide
            authenticity unless combined with a secret key (as in MACs).
            On the other hand, block and stream ciphers primarily focus
            on confidentiality but can also be adapted for
            authentication.</p></li>
            </ul>
            <p>Summary:</p>
            <ul>
            <li>MACs ensure message integrity and authenticity using
            hash functions or symmetric ciphers.</li>
            <li>SHA-1 and SHA-2 serve as hash functions that can be used
            in MAC constructions.</li>
            <li>Block and Stream Ciphers can be utilized in MAC
            algorithms to enhance security by incorporating encryption
            techniques.</li>
            </ul>
            <p>By understanding these components and their
            relationships, one can appreciate the layered security
            approaches in cryptography.</p>
