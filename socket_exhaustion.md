# Socket Exhaustion

Socket exhaustion occurs when a system runs out of available sockets to establish new network connections. This can happen when the number of open sockets exceeds the system's limit, leading to failures in creating new connections. Socket exhaustion can be caused by various factors, including:

1. **High Connection Volume**: A large number of simultaneous connections, such as in high-traffic web servers or applications with many clients, can exhaust the available sockets
2. **Improper Resource Management**: Not properly closing sockets after use can lead to socket leaks, where sockets remain open and consume resources unnecessarily
3. **Long-Lived Connections**: Connections that remain open for extended periods without being closed can contribute to socket exhaustion
4. **Port Range Limits**: The system's available port range for outgoing connections can be exhausted, especially if many short-lived connections are created in quick succession
5. **Firewall or Network Configuration**: Misconfigured firewalls or network settings can limit the number of allowable connections, leading to socket exhaustion

#### Symptoms of Socket Exhaustion
* Inability to establish new network connections
* Errors such as "Address already in use" or "Too many open files".
* Degraded application performance or crashes

#### Mitigation Strategies
1. **Proper Socket Management**: Ensure that sockets are properly closed after use to free up resources
2. **Connection Pooling**: Reuse existing connections instead of creating new ones for each request
3. **Timeouts and Keep-Alives**: Implement timeouts and keep-alive mechanisms to close idle connections
4. **Increase System Limits**: Adjust system settings to increase the maximum number of open sockets or file descriptors
5. **Load Balancing**: Distribute the load across multiple servers to reduce the number of connections handled by a single server
