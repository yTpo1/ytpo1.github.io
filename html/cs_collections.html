            between Data Structures and Collections</h2>
            <p><a href="./data_structures.html">Data structures</a> are
            ways of organizing and storing data so that they can be
            accessed and modified efficiently. They are the fundamental
            building blocks used to create collections and other complex
            data types.</p>
            <p>Collections are specialized classes provided b the .NET
            framework that are designed to store, manage, and manipulate
            groups of objects. Collections are built using various data
            structures.</p>
            <p>Examples of collections are: * List * Dictionary *
            HashSet * NameValueCollection * Queue * Stack</p>
            <p>In summary, data structures are the underlying mechanisms
            used to implement collections. Collections provide a
            higher-level, more user-friendly interface for working with
            groups of objects.</p>
