            <p>JWT (JSON Web Token), is a compact, URL-sage means of
            representing claims to be transferred between two parties.
            The claims in a JWT are encoded as a JSON object that is
            used as the payload of a JSON Web Signature (JWS) structure
            or as the plaintext of a JSON Web Encryption (JWE)
            structure, enabling the claims to be digitally signed or
            integrity protected with a MEssage Authentication Code (MAC)
            and/or encrypted.</p>
            <p>A JWT consists of three parts, separated by dots (.):</p>
            <ol type="1">
            <li><strong>Header</strong>: Contains metadata about the
            token, such as the type of token (JWT) and the signing
            algorithm used (e.g., HMAC SHA256 or RSA).</li>
            <li><strong>Payload</strong>: Contains the claims. Claims
            are statements about an entity (typically, the user) and
            additional data. There are three types of claims:
            <ul>
            <li><strong>Registered claims</strong>: Predefined claims
            that are not mandatory but recommended, such as
            <code>iis</code> (issuer), <code>exp</code> (expiration
            time), <code>sub</code> (subject), and <code>aud</code>
            (audience).</li>
            <li><strong>Public claims</strong>: Custom claims that can
            be defined by the user.</li>
            <li><strong>Private claims</strong>: Custom claims created
            to share information between parties that agree on using
            them.</li>
            </ul></li>
            <li><strong>Signature</strong>: Used to verify that the
            sender of the JWT is who it says it is and to ensure that
            the message wasn't changed along the way. The signature is
            created by taking the encoded header, the encoded payload, a
            secret, and the algorithm specified in the header, and
            signing them.</li>
            </ol>
            <p>Example of a JWT:</p>
            <pre><code>to do...</code></pre>
            <ul>
            <li><strong>Header</strong>:</li>
            <li><strong>Payload</strong>:</li>
            <li><strong>Signature</strong>:</li>
            </ul>
