            <p>In software development, a stub is a piece of code used
            to stand in for some other programming functionality. Stubs
            are typically used in testing to simulate the behavior or
            complex, real components that are not yet implemented or are
            difficult to incorporate into a test environment. They allow
            developers to test parts of the system in isolation.</p>
