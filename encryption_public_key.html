            <p>A public key is one half of a key pair used in asymmetric
            cryptography, which is a method of encrypting data and
            ensuring secure communication. It is designed to be shared
            openly and is used for two main purposes: encryption and
            digital signatures.</p>
            <p>Key Characteristics of Public Keys:</p>
            <ol type="1">
            <li><strong>Asymmetric Pair:</strong> The public key is
            paired with a private key. The private key is kept secret by
            the owner, while the public key can be distributed
            freely.</li>
            <li><strong>Encryption:</strong> When someone wants to send
            a secure message, they can encrypt the message using the
            recipient's public key. Only the recipient, who possesses
            the corresponding private key, can decrypt the message.</li>
            <li><strong>Digital Signatures:</strong> A public key can
            also be used to verify digital signatures. When a sender
            signs a message with their private key, the recipient can
            use the sender's public key to verify that the signature is
            valid and that the message has not been altered.</li>
            <li><strong>Key Distribution:</strong> Public keys are often
            distributed via key servers or shared through secure
            channels to ensure that recipients can obtain the correct
            public key for encryption or verification purposes.</li>
            <li><strong>Widely Used in Protocols:</strong> Public keys
            are integral to various security protocols, including
            SSL/TLS for secure web communications, email encryption
            (like PGP and OpenPGP), and secure file transfers.</li>
            </ol>
            <p><strong>Example Usage:</strong></p>
            <ul>
            <li><strong>Email Encryption:</strong> If Alice wants to
            send a secure email to Bob, she encrypts the message using
            Bob's public key. Only Bob can decrypt it using his private
            key.</li>
            <li><strong>Digital Signatures:</strong> If Bob signs a
            document with his private key, Alice can verify the
            signature using Bob's public key, confirming the document's
            authenticity.</li>
            </ul>
            <p><strong>Conclusion</strong> Public keys play a crucial
            role in ensuring secure communications and data integrity in
            asymmetric cryptography. Their ability to facilitate secure
            exchanges without requiring the sender and recipient to
            share secret keys makes them essential in modern security
            protocols.</p>
