# app.UseAuthentication()

* **Purpose**: Adds the authentication middleware to the request pipeline. This middleware is responsible for validating the authentication credentials of incoming requests.
* **Functionality**: It checks for the presence of authentication tokens (e.g., JWT tokens, cookies) in the request and validates them. If the credentials are valid, the middleware sets the user principal (identity) for the request.
