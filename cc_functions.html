            <h1 id="functions">Functions</h1>
            <h2 id="functions-should-be-small">Functions should be
            small</h2>
            <p>Functions should be short and descriptive.</p>
            <h3 id="blocks-and-indenting">Blocks and Indenting</h3>
            <p>This implies that the blocks within if statements, else
            statements, while statements, and so on should be one line
            long. Probably that line should be a function call. Not only
            does this keep the enclosing function small, but it also
            adds documentary value because the function called within
            the block can have a nicely descriptive name.</p>
            <p>This also implies that functions should not be large
            enough to hold nested structures. Therefore, the indent
            level of a function should not be greater than one or two.
            This, of course, makes the functions easier to read and
            understand.</p>
            <h3 id="do-one-thing">Do One Thing</h3>
            <p>The problem with this statement is that it is hard to
            know what “one thing” is.</p>
            <p>If a function does only those steps that are one level
            below the stated name of the function, then the function is
            doing one thing. After all, the reason we write functions is
            to decompose a larger concept (in other words, the name of
            the function) into a set of steps at the next level of
            abstraction.</p>
            <p>So, another way to know that a function is doing more
            than “one thing” is if you can extract another function from
            it with a name that is not merely a restatement of its
            implementation.</p>
            <p>Sections within Functions Functions that do one thing
            cannot be reasonably divided into sections. Like for
            example: declarations, initializations, sieve, etc.</p>
            <h3 id="one-level-of-abstraction-per-function">One Level of
            Abstraction per Function</h3>
            <p>Mixing levels of abstraction within a function is always
            confusing. Readers may not be able to tell whether a
            particular expression is an essential concept or a detail.
            Worse, like broken windows, once details are mixed with
            essential concepts, more and more details tend to accrete
            within the function.</p>
            <h3 id="use-descriptive-names">Use Descriptive Names</h3>
            <p>Don’t be afraid to make a name long. A long descriptive
            name is better than a short enigmatic name. A long
            descriptive name is better than a long descriptive comment.
            Use a naming convention that allows multiple words to be
            easily read in the function names, and then make use of
            those multiple words to give the function a name that says
            what it does.</p>
            <h3 id="function-arguments">Function Arguments</h3>
            <p>The ideal number of arguments for a function is zero
            (niladic). Next comes one (monadic), followed closely by two
            (dyadic). Three arguments (triadic) should be avoided where
            possible. More than three (polyadic) requires very special
            justification—and then shouldn’t be used anyway.</p>
            <p>Arguments are even harder from a testing point of view.
            Imagine the difficulty of writing all the test cases to
            ensure that all the various combinations of arguments work
            properly. If there are no arguments, this is trivial. If
            there’s one argument, it’s not too hard. With two arguments
            the problem gets a bit more challenging. With more than two
            arguments, testing every combination of appropriate values
            can be daunting.</p>
            <p>Output arguments are harder to understand than input
            arguments. When we read a function, we are used to the idea
            of information going in to the function through arguments
            and out through the return value. We don’t usually expect
            information to be going out through the arguments. So output
            arguments often cause us to do a double-take.</p>
            <h3 id="flag-arguments">Flag Arguments</h3>
            <p>Flag arguments are ugly. Passing a boolean into a
            function is a truly terrible practice. It immediately
            complicates the signature of the method, loudly proclaiming
            that this function does more than one thing. It does one
            thing if the flag is true and another if the flag is
            false!</p>
            <h3 id="argument-objects">Argument Objects</h3>
            <p>When a function seems to need more than two or three
            arguments, it is likely that some of those arguments ought
            to be wrapped into a class of their own. Consider, for
            example, the difference between the two following
            declarations:</p>
            <div class="sourceCode" id="cb1"><pre
            class="sourceCode java"><code class="sourceCode java"><span id="cb1-1"><a href="#cb1-1" aria-hidden="true" tabindex="-1"></a>Circle <span class="fu">makeCircle</span><span class="op">(</span><span class="dt">double</span> x<span class="op">,</span> <span class="dt">double</span> y<span class="op">,</span> <span class="dt">double</span> radius<span class="op">);</span></span>
<span id="cb1-2"><a href="#cb1-2" aria-hidden="true" tabindex="-1"></a>Circle <span class="fu">makeCircle</span><span class="op">(</span><span class="bu">Point</span> center<span class="op">,</span> <span class="dt">double</span> radius<span class="op">);</span></span></code></pre></div>
            <p>Reducing the number of arguments by creating objects out
            of them may seem like cheating, but it’s not. When groups of
            variables are passed together, the way x and y are in the
            example above, they are likely part of a concept that
            deserves a name of its own.</p>
