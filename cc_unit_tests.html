            <p>A test suite:</p>
            <ul>
            <li>give the ability to ensure that changes to the code base
            work as expected</li>
            <li>give the ability to ensure that changes to one part of
            the system does not break the other part of the system</li>
            <li>Removes the fear of making changes.</li>

            <li>Keep your test code clean.</li>
            </ol>
            <p>It is unit tests that keep our code flexible,
            maintainable, and reusable.</p>
            <p>What makes a clean test? Three things. Readability,
            readability, and readability. Readability is perhaps even
            more important in unit tests than it is in production code.
            What makes tests readable? The same thing that makes all
            code readable: clarity, simplicity, and density of
            expression. In a test you want to say a lot with as few
            expressions as possible.</p>
            <p>When writing unit test, design them to be read.<br />
            Abstract the details that will need to be understood before
            the test makes any sense.</p>
