# SSH Protocol

SSH, or Secure SHell, is a network protocol that provides a secure way to access a remote computer over an unsecured network. It is commonly used for remote command-line login and execution, as well as for secure file transfers and tunneling other network services.

Key features of SSH include:
* **Encryption**: SSH encrypts the data being transmitted, ensuring that it cannot be intercepted and read by unauthorized parties.
* **Authentication**: SSH supports various authentication methods, including password-based authentication and public key authentication, to verify the identity of the user.
* **Integrity**: SSH ensures the integrity of the data being transmitted, preventing tampering and data corruption.
