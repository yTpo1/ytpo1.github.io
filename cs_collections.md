# .NET C# - Collections

## Difference between Data Structures and Collections
[Data structures](./data_structures.md) are ways of organizing and storing data so that they can be accessed and modified efficiently. They are the fundamental building blocks used to create collections and other complex data types.

Collections are specialized classes provided b the .NET framework that are designed to store, manage, and manipulate groups of objects. Collections are built using various data structures.

Examples of collections are:
    * List
    * Dictionary
    * HashSet
    * NameValueCollection
    * Queue
    * Stack

In summary, data structures are the underlying mechanisms used to implement collections. Collections provide a higher-level, more user-friendly interface for working with groups of objects.
