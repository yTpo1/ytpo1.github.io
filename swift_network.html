            network (Society for Worldwide Interbank Financial

            <p>The SWIFT network (Society for Worldwide Interbank
            Financial Telecommunication) is a global messaging platform
            used by financial institutions to securely exchange
            information and instructions related to financial
            transactions. It plays a crucial role in facilitating
            international banking and finance.</p>
            <p>Secure Messaging: SWIFT provides a secure and
            standardized method for banks and financial institutions to
            send and receive messages, such as payment orders,
            confirmations, and other financial communications.</p>
            <p>Standardized Formats: SWIFT messages, particularly those
            in the MT (Message Type) format, ensure that communications
            are consistent and easily interpretable across different
            institutions.</p>
