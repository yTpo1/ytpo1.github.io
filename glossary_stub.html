            <p>In software development, a stub is a piece of code used
            to stand in for some other programming functionality. Stubs
            are typically used in testing to simulate the behavior or
            complex, real components that are not yet implemented or are
            difficult to incorporate into a test environment. They allow
            developers to test parts of the system in isolation.</p>
            <p>Stub - A stub is a controllable replacement for an
            existing dependency (or collaborator) in the system. By
            using a stub, you can test your code without dealing with
            the dependency directly. By default, a stub starts out as a
            fake.</p>
