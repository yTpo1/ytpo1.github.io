            <p>Chapter 7: Error Handling</p>
            <p>Error Handling should not obscure logic. Business logic
            should not mix with Error Handling logic. Both should be
            separate.</p>
            <ul>
            <li>Use <strong>exceptions</strong> rather than Returning
            error codes</li>
            <li>Provide context with Exceptions. Create informative
            messages that relay the intent of the operation that failed.
            Mention the operation that failed and the type of
            failure.</li>
            <li>Often a single exception class is fine for a particular
            area of code. The information sent with the exception can
            distinguish the errors. Use different classes only if there
            are times when you want to catch one exception and allow the
            other one to pass through.</li>
            <li>Don't return <code>Null</code>
            <ul>
            <li>When we return null, we are essentially creating work
            for ourselves and foisting problems upon our callers. All it
            takes is one missing null check to send an application
            spinning out of control.</li>
            <li>If you are tempted to return null from a method,
            consider throwing an exception or returning a SPECIAL CASE
            object instead</li>
            <li>Use <code>String.Empty</code>, <code>Guid.Empty</code>,
            <code>Enumerable.Empty&lt;T&gt;()</code></li>
            </ul></li>
            <li>Don't pass <code>Null</code>
            <ul>
            <li>In most programming languages there is no good way to
            deal with a null that is passed by a caller accidentally.
            Because this is the case, the rational approach is to forbid
            passing null by default. When you do, you can code with the
            knowledge that a null in an argument list is an indication
            of a problem, and end up with far fewer careless
            mistakes.</li>
