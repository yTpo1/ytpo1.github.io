            <p><strong>Definition:</strong> The Internet Protocol (IP)
            is a set of rules or protocols that govern how data is sent
            and received over the internet and other networks.</p>
            <p><strong>Function:</strong> IP is responsible for routing
            packets of data from the source to the destination across
            multiple networks. It handles addressing and packet
            forwarding.</p>
            <p><strong>Versions:</strong> The most commonly used
            versions are IPv4 (Internet Protocol version 4) and IPv6
            (Internet Protocol version 6). IPv4 uses 32-bit addresses,
            while IPv6 uses 128-bit addresses.</p>
            <p><strong>Role in Networking:</strong> IP operates at Layer
            3 of the OSI model (Network Layer) and is a critical
            component of the Internet Protocol Suite, which also
            includes protocols like TCP (Transmission Control Protocol)
            and UDP (User Datagram Protocol).</p>
            <p><strong>Difference between the Internet Protocol (IP) and
            an IP Address</strong> In essence, the IP protocol is the
            method of communication, while the IP address is the address
            used in that communication.</p>
