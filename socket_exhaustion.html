            <h1 id="socket-exhaustion">Socket Exhaustion</h1>
            <p>Socket exhaustion occurs when a system runs out of
            available sockets to establish new network connections. This
            can happen when the number of open sockets exceeds the
            system's limit, leading to failures in creating new
            connections. Socket exhaustion can be caused by various
            factors, including:</p>
            <ol type="1">
            <li><strong>High Connection Volume</strong>: A large number
            of simultaneous connections, such as in high-traffic web
            servers or applications with many clients, can exhaust the
            available sockets</li>
            <li><strong>Improper Resource Management</strong>: Not
            properly closing sockets after use can lead to socket leaks,
            where sockets remain open and consume resources
            unnecessarily</li>
            <li><strong>Long-Lived Connections</strong>: Connections
            that remain open for extended periods without being closed
            can contribute to socket exhaustion</li>
            <li><strong>Port Range Limits</strong>: The system's
            available port range for outgoing connections can be
            exhausted, especially if many short-lived connections are
            created in quick succession</li>
            <li><strong>Firewall or Network Configuration</strong>:
            Misconfigured firewalls or network settings can limit the
            number of allowable connections, leading to socket
            exhaustion</li>
            </ol>
            <h4 id="symptoms-of-socket-exhaustion">Symptoms of Socket
            Exhaustion</h4>
            <ul>
            <li>Inability to establish new network connections</li>
            <li>Errors such as "Address already in use" or "Too many
            open files".</li>
            <li>Degraded application performance or crashes</li>
            </ul>
            <h4 id="mitigation-strategies">Mitigation Strategies</h4>
            <ol type="1">
            <li><strong>Proper Socket Management</strong>: Ensure that
            sockets are properly closed after use to free up
            resources</li>
            <li><strong>Connection Pooling</strong>: Reuse existing
            connections instead of creating new ones for each
            request</li>
            <li><strong>Timeouts and Keep-Alives</strong>: Implement
            timeouts and keep-alive mechanisms to close idle
            connections</li>
            <li><strong>Increase System Limits</strong>: Adjust system
            settings to increase the maximum number of open sockets or
            file descriptors</li>
            <li><strong>Load Balancing</strong>: Distribute the load
            across multiple servers to reduce the number of connections
            handled by a single server</li>
            </ol>
