            <h2 id="certificate-fields">Certificate Fields</h2>
            <p>Its <strong>Subject</strong> field describes Wikipedia as
            an organization, and its <strong>Subject Alternative Name
            (SAN)</strong> field for DNS describes the hostnames for
            which it could be used.</p>
            <h3 id="subject-field">Subject field</h3>
            <p>The "Subject" field of a certificate contains information
            that identifies the entity (such as a person, organization,
            or device) to which the certificate is issued. Hereâ€™s a
            breakdown of its components and significance:</p>
            <p><strong>Components of the Subject Field</strong></p>
            <ol type="1">
            <li><strong>Common Name (CN):</strong>
            <ul>
            <li>This is the primary identifier in the "Subject"
            field.</li>
            <li>For TLS/SSL certificates, the Common Name typically
            represents the domain of the website (e.g., <a
            href="http://www.example.com">www.example.com</a>).</li>
            <li>For other types of certificates, it might represent the
            name of an individual or an organization.</li>
            <li>In the case of wildcard certificates, it may appear as
            *.example.com.</li>
            </ul></li>
            <li><strong>Organization (O):</strong> The legal name of the
            organization that owns the certificate.</li>
            <li><strong>Organizational Unit (OU):</strong> A subdivision
            or department within the organization (optional).</li>
            <li><strong>Country (C):</strong> The <a
            href="./data_standards_country_codes.html">two-letter ISO code
            for the country</a> where the organization is located (e.g.,
            US for the United States).</li>
            <li><strong>State or Province (ST):</strong> The state or
            province where the organization is registered (not always
            included).</li>
            <li><strong>Locality (L):</strong> The city or locality of
            the organization (optional).</li>
            </ol>
            <pre><code>Certificate:
   Data:
       Subject: C=US, ST=California, L=San Francisco, O=Wikimedia Foundation, Inc., CN=*.wikipedia.org</code></pre>
            <p>In summary, the Subject field is a crucial part of a
            TLS/SSL certificate that provides identifying information
            about the certificate holder, helping to establish trust and
            secure communications.</p>
            <h3 id="subject-alternative-name-san">Subject Alternative
            Name (SAN)</h3>
            <p>The Subject Alternative Name (SAN) field is an extension
            in a TLS/SSL certificate that allows the specification of
            additional identities for which the certificate is
            valid.</p>
            <p><strong>Purpose of the SAN Field</strong></p>
            <ol type="1">
            <li><strong>Multiple Domain Support:</strong> The SAN field
            enables a single certificate to secure multiple domain names
            and subdomains. This is particularly useful for
            organizations that manage several websites or services.</li>
            <li><strong>Flexibility:</strong> It provides flexibility in
            certificate management by allowing multiple domains to be
            covered under one certificate, reducing the need for
            multiple certificates.</li>
            </ol>
            <p>Example of a SAN field:</p>
            <pre><code>Subject Alternative Name:
    DNS Name=www.example.com
    DNS Name=example.com
    DNS Name=mail.example.com
    IP Address=192.0.2.1</code></pre>
            <h4 id="summary">Summary</h4>
            <p>The Subject Alternative Name (SAN) field is an essential
            component of modern TLS/SSL certificates, allowing multiple
            domain names, IP addresses, and email addresses to be
            associated with a single certificate. This flexibility
            enhances security, simplifies certificate management, and
            ensures broader compatibility with web browsers and
            clients.</p>
            <h2 id="certificate-thumbprint">Certificate Thumbprint</h2>
            <p>A <strong>Certificate Thumbprint</strong> (or
            <strong>Fingerprint</strong>) is a unique identifier for a
            digital certificate. It is a hash value computed from the
            certificate's data using a cryptographic hash function such
            as SHA-1 or SHA-256.</p>
            <p>The thumbprint can be used to verify the integrity of the
            certificate. If even a small change occurs in the
            certificate's data, the thumbprint will change, indicating
            that the certificate has been altered.</p>
            <p>A certificate thumbprint <strong>is not a field</strong>
            within the certificate itself, but rather a unique
            identifier derived from the certificate.</p>
