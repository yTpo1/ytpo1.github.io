# Internet Protocol (IP)

**Definition:**
The Internet Protocol (IP) is a set of rules or protocols that govern how data is sent and received over the internet and other networks.

**Function:**
IP is responsible for routing packets of data from the source to the destination across multiple networks. It handles addressing and packet forwarding.

**Versions:**
The most commonly used versions are IPv4 (Internet Protocol version 4) and IPv6 (Internet Protocol version 6). IPv4 uses 32-bit addresses, while IPv6 uses 128-bit addresses.

**Role in Networking:**
IP operates at Layer 3 of the OSI model (Network Layer) and is a critical component of the Internet Protocol Suite, which also includes protocols like TCP (Transmission Control Protocol) and UDP (User Datagram Protocol).

**Difference between the Internet Protocol (IP) and an IP Address**
In essence, the IP protocol is the method of communication, while the IP address is the address used in that communication.
