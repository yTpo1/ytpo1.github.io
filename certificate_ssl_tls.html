            Certificate?</h1>
            <ul>
            <li><p><strong>Definition:</strong> An SSL (Secure Sockets
            Layer) or TLS (Transport Layer Security) certificate is a
            digital certificate that authenticates the identity of a
            website and enables an encrypted connection between the web
            server and the user's browser.</p></li>
            <li><p><strong>Purpose:</strong> Certificates ensure that
            data transmitted between the user and the server is secure
            and that the website is genuine, helping to establish
            trust.</p></li>
            <li><p>When a website is hosted, the SSL/TLS certificate
            must be installed on the web server. This allows the server
            to establish secure connections using HTTPS.</p></li>
            <li><p><strong>Domain Validation:</strong> To obtain a
            certificate, the domain owner must prove ownership of the
            domain. This is typically done through a validation process
            by the certificate authority (CA).</p></li>
            </ul>
            <h4 id="types-of-certificate-validation">Types of
            Certificate Validation:</h4>
            <ul>
            <li><strong>Domain Validated (DV):</strong> Basic
            validation; verifies ownership of the domain.</li>
            <li><strong>Organization Validated (OV):</strong> Includes
            verification of the organization behind the website.</li>
            <li><strong>Extended Validation (EV):</strong> Provides the
            highest level of assurance, requiring extensive verification
            of the organization.</li>
            </ul>
            <h4 id="connection-to-routing">Connection to Routing</h4>
            <ul>
            <li><strong>Secure Routing:</strong> When a user enters a
            URL starting with https://, the browser requests a secure
            connection to the server. The server presents its SSL/TLS
            certificate during the connection process.</li>
            <li><strong>SSL Handshake:</strong> This process involves
            the browser and server exchanging cryptographic keys to
            establish a secure session. The certificate is used to
            authenticate the server's identity, ensuring that the user
            is connecting to the intended website and not an
            imposter.</li>
            <li><strong>Trust Chain:</strong> Certificates are issued by
            trusted certificate authorities (CAs). Browsers come
            preloaded with a list of trusted CAs. If the certificate is
            valid and signed by a trusted CA, the browser establishes a
            secure connection.</li>
