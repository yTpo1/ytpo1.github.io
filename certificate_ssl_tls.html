            <p>What is an SSL/TLS Certificate?</p>
            <p><strong>Definition:</strong> An SSL (Secure Sockets
            Layer) or TLS (Transport Layer Security) certificate is a
            digital certificate that authenticates the identity of a
            website and enables an encrypted connection between the web
            server and the user's browser.</p>
            <p><strong>Purpose:</strong> Certificates ensure that data
            transmitted between the user and the server is secure and
            that the website is genuine, helping to establish trust.</p>

            <h3 id="step-1-certificate-issuance">Step 1: Certificate
            Issuance</h3>
            <ol type="1">
            <li><strong>Certificate Signing Request (CSR):</strong>
            <ul>
            <li>The website owner generates a CSR, which includes the
            public key and information about the organization (e.g.,
            domain name, organization name).</li>
            <li>This CSR is sent to a Certificate Authority (CA) to
            request an SSL certificate.</li>
            </ul></li>
            <li><strong>Validation:</strong>
            <ul>
            <li>The CA verifies the information provided in the CSR.
            Depending on the type of certificate (Domain Validation,
            Organization Validation, or Extended Validation), this
            process may vary in complexity.</li>
            </ul></li>
            <li><strong>Certificate Issuance:</strong>
            <ul>
            <li>Once validated, the CA issues the SSL certificate, which
            includes the website's public key, information about the
            issuer, the validity period, and the digital signature of
            the CA.</li>
            </ul></li>
            </ol>
            <h3 id="step-2-ssl-handshake">Step 2: SSL Handshake</h3>
            <ol type="1">
            <li><strong>Client Connection:</strong>
            <ul>
            <li>When a user accesses a website (e.g., <a
            href="https://www.example.com">https://www.example.com</a>),
            the browser initiates a connection to the server.</li>
            </ul></li>
            <li><strong>Server Response:</strong>
            <ul>
            <li>The server responds by sending its SSL certificate to
            the browser.</li>
            </ul></li>
            <li><strong>Validation by Client:</strong>
            <ul>
            <li>The browser checks the certificate:
            <ul>
            <li>It verifies the certificate's validity period.</li>
            <li>It checks that the certificate is issued by a trusted
            CA.</li>
            <li>It ensures that the domain name matches the one in the
            certificate.</li>
            </ul></li>
            </ul></li>
            <li><strong>Public Key Exchange:</strong>
            <ul>
            <li>If the certificate is valid, the browser uses the public
            key from the certificate to encrypt a randomly generated
            session key.</li>
            </ul></li>
            <li><strong>Session Key Establishment:</strong>
            <ul>
            <li>The encrypted session key is sent to the server, which
            uses its private key to decrypt it. Now both the server and
            client share a session key for symmetric encryption.</li>
            </ul></li>
            </ol>
            <h3 id="step-3-encrypted-communication">Step 3: Encrypted
            Communication</h3>
            <ul>
            <li>With the session key established, all subsequent data
            transmitted between the client and server is encrypted using
            this symmetric key, ensuring confidentiality and
            integrity.</li>
            </ul>
            <h4 id="connection-to-routing">Connection to Routing</h4>
            <ul>
            <li><strong>Secure Routing:</strong> When a user enters a
            URL starting with https://, the browser requests a secure
            connection to the server. The server presents its SSL/TLS
            certificate during the connection process.</li>
            <li><strong>SSL Handshake:</strong> This process involves
            the browser and server exchanging cryptographic keys to
            establish a secure session. The certificate is used to
            authenticate the server's identity, ensuring that the user
            is connecting to the intended website and not an
            imposter.</li>
            <li><strong>Trust Chain:</strong> Certificates are issued by
            trusted certificate authorities (CAs). Browsers come
            preloaded with a list of trusted CAs. If the certificate is
            valid and signed by a trusted CA, the browser establishes a
            secure connection.</li>
