            <p>The hosts file is a plain text file used by an operating
            system to map hostnames to IP addresses. It is a simple way
            to manually define the IP address associated with a
            particular domain name, bypassing the need for a DNS lookup.
            The hosts file is typically used for local network
            configurations, testing and development purposes.</p>
            <p>Location:</p>
            <ul>
            <li>On Windows: C:\Windows\System32\drivers\etc\hosts</li>
            <li>On Linux: /etc/hosts</li>
            </ul>
            <p>Format:</p>
            <ul>
            <li>Each line in the hosts file contains an IP address
            followed by one or more hostnames</li>
            <li>Lines starting with <code>#</code> are comments and are
            ignored by the system</li>
            </ul>
            <p>Usage:</p>
            <ul>
            <li>The hosts file is consulted before DNS queries, so
            entries in the the hosts file take precedence over DNS</li>
            <li>It can be used to block access to certain websites by
            mapping their domain names to 127.0.0.1 (localhost)</li>
            <li>It is useful for testing and development by mapping
            domain names to local or test server IP addresses</li>
            </ul>
