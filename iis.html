            <p>Application pools in Internet Information Services (IIS)
            are a fundamental feature that provide a way to isolate web
            applications for better security, reliability, and
            availability. Each application pool runs its own set of
            worker processes (w3wp.exe), which means that applications
            in different pools do not affect each other.</p>
            <h3 id="no-managed-code-setting">No Managed Code
            setting</h3>
            <p>The "No Managed Code" setting in IIS refers to an
            application pool configuration where the application pool
            does not load the .NET runtime. This setting is used for
            applications that do not require the .NET runtime, such as
            static websites or application written in other programming
            languages like PHP or classic ASP or .NET core.</p>
            <p>When you set the application pool to "No Managed Code"
            IIS will not attempt to load the .NET runtime, which can
            improve performance and reduce resource usage for the
            non-.NET applications.</p>
            <p>ASP.NET Core runs in a separate process and manages the
            runtime. ASP.NET Core doesn't rely on loading the desktop
            CLR (.NET CLR). The Core Common Language Runtime (CoreCLR)
            for .NET Core is booted to host the app in the worker
            process. Setting the .NET CLR version to
            <code>No Managed Code</code> is optional but recommended. <a
