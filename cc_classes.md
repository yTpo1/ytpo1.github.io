# Classes
Classes should be small.
* Count responsibilities.
* The name of a class should describe what responsibilities it fulfills. If we cannot derive a concise name for a class, then it’s likely too large. 
* We should also be able to write a brief description of the class in about 25 words, without using the words “if,” “and,” “or,” or “but.”
