            <h1 id="ip-address">IP Address</h1>
            <h4 id="definition">Definition:</h4>
            <p>An IP address is a unique identifier assigned to each
            device connected to a network that uses the IP for
            communication.</p>
            <h4 id="function">Function:</h4>
            <p>It serves as an address that allows devices to locate and
            communicate with each other over the network. Each device
            must have a unique IP address within a given network.</p>
            <h4 id="format">Format:</h4>
            <p>An IPv4 address is typically represented as four decimal
            numbers separated by periods (e.g., 192.168.1.1), while an
            IPv6 address is represented in hexadecimal format, separated
            by colons (e.g.,
            2001:0db8:85a3:0000:0000:8a2e:0370:7334).</p>
            <h4 id="types">Types:</h4>
            <p>There are public IP addresses (accessible over the
            internet) and private IP addresses (used within local
            networks).</p>
            <h2
            id="private-ip-addresses-used-within-local-networks">Private
            IP addresses (used within local networks)</h2>
            <p>Private IP addresses are reserved for use within local
            networks and are not routable on the public internet. They
            allow devices on a local network to communicate with each
            other without requiring a globally unique address.</p>
            <h4
            id="characteristics-of-private-ip-addresses">Characteristics
            of Private IP Addresses</h4>
            <ol type="1">
            <li><p>Non-Routable: Private IP addresses cannot be accessed
            directly from the internet. They are used exclusively for
            internal network communication.</p></li>
            <li><p>Address Ranges: The following ranges are designated
            for private IP addresses:</p></li>
            </ol>
            <ul>
            <li><strong>IPv4:</strong>
            <ul>
            <li>10.0.0.0 to 10.255.255.255 (10.0.0.0/8)</li>
            <li>172.16.0.0 to 172.31.255.255 (172.16.0.0/12)</li>
            <li>192.168.0.0 to 192.168.255.255 (192.168.0.0/16)</li>
            </ul></li>
            <li><strong>IPv6:</strong>
            <ul>
            <li>Unique Local Addresses (ULA) range: fc00::/7</li>
            </ul></li>
            </ul>
            <ol start="3" type="1">
            <li><p>Common Usage: Private IP addresses are commonly used
            in home networks, corporate networks, and any environment
            where multiple devices need to communicate without direct
            access to the internet.</p></li>
            <li><p>NAT (Network Address Translation): To access the
            internet, devices with private IP addresses typically use a
            router that employs NAT. The router translates the private
            IP addresses into a public IP address for external
            communication.</p></li>
            <li><p>Address Management: Private IP addresses can be
            reused across different networks. For example, multiple home
            networks can use the same private IP range (e.g.,
            192.168.1.x) without conflict.</p></li>
            </ol>
            <h4 id="benefits-of-private-ip-addresses">Benefits of
            Private IP Addresses</h4>
            <ul>
            <li>Security:
            <ul>
            <li>By using private IP addresses, devices are shielded from
            direct exposure to the internet, reducing the risk of
            unauthorized access.</li>
            </ul></li>
            <li>Address Conservation:
            <ul>
            <li>They help conserve the limited number of available
            public IP addresses by allowing multiple devices to share a
            single public IP through NAT.</li>
            </ul></li>
            <li>Ease of Management:
            <ul>
            <li>Private IP addressing simplifies network design and
            management, allowing easy configuration of local
            networks.</li>
            </ul></li>
            </ul>
            <h4 id="example-of-private-ip-address-usage">Example of
            Private IP Address Usage</h4>
            <p>In a typical home network:</p>
            <ul>
            <li><strong>Router:</strong> Assigned a private IP address
            (e.g., 192.168.1.1).</li>
            <li><strong>Devices:</strong> Each device (smartphones,
            laptops, printers) receives a unique private IP (e.g.,
            192.168.1.2, 192.168.1.3, etc.) from the router's DHCP
            service.</li>
            </ul>
            <h4 id="summary">Summary</h4>
            <p>Private IP addresses facilitate internal communication
            within local networks, providing security and efficient
            usage of IP address space. They play a crucial role in
            modern networking, enabling seamless connectivity for
            devices in homes and organizations alike.</p>
