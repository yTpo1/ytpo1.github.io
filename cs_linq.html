            <h1 id="linq">LINQ</h1>
            <h2 id="iqueryable-vs-ienumerable">IQueryable vs
            IEnumerable</h2>
            <p><strong>Is there a difference between using IQueryable
            and IEnumerable when running LINQ methods on a data
            object?</strong></p>
            <p>Yes, there is. The main difference lies in how and when
            the query is executed, as well as performance
            implications.</p>
            <ul>
            <li><strong>IQueryable</strong>:
            <ul>
            <li><strong>Deferred Execution</strong>: IQueryable supports
            deferred execution, meaning the query is not executed until
            you enumerate over teh results.</li>
            <li><strong>Query Translation</strong>: IQueryable is
            designed to work with data sources that support query
            translation, such as databases. The LINQ query is translated
            into the native query language of the data source (e.g., SQL
            for a database)</li>
            <li><strong>Performance</strong>: Because the query is
            translated and executed on the data source, it can be more
            efficient, especially for large datasets. The data source
            can optimize the query and return only the necessary
            data.</li>
            </ul></li>
            <li><strong>IEnumerable</strong>:
            <ul>
            <li><strong>Immediate Execution</strong>: IEnumerable does
            not support deferred execution. When you call a LINQ method
            on a IEnumerable, the query is executed immediately.</li>
            <li><strong>In-Memory Processing</strong>: IEnumerable works
            with in-memory collections. The entire dataset is loaded
            into memory, and the LINQ query is executed on the in-memory
            data.</li>
            <li><strong>Performance</strong>: For large datasets, using
            IEnumerable can be less efficient because the entire dataset
            is loaded into memory before the query is executed.</li>
            </ul></li>
            </ul>
            <p>Use <code>IQueryable</code> when working with data
            sources that support query translation and deferred
            execution, such as databases. This allows for more efficient
            querying and better performance for large datasets.</p>
